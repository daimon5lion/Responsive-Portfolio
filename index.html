        <p id="ps">Caution! You are stepping in a personal webpage of Lei Chen, who is a current student of GW
            Coding
            Bootcamp,
            and a Fullstack Webdeveloper to be.<br><br>
            Most of Lei's friends do not even know what does he do for living, and Lei won't tell them that he is a
            loan officer in MD, who can help people
            to get their home mortgage. But almost all of people who know about Lei, would describe his as a
            pro-fishing man, because he caught almost all kinds
            of fish in his area, from tiny bluegills to big sharks, from inland lakes to surf. <br><br>A few people
            know
            that
            Lei also play soccer and also coaching soccer
            for their kids, since their kids used to learn soccer with Lei, but it turned out almost all of the
            kids
            quit right soccer after their first month. Gaming
            is also a thing which Lei likes to do, but he only plays the boring ones. <br><br>Finally, no one knows
            that
            Lei is
            also a boxer inside, because he only practices
            boxing in his deep mind, and had never brought out.
